# Python Data Scraping
Used Python3 within Jupyter Notebooks to scrape data from an Amazon product page.
Scraped the price, title, and date from the page.
A csv was then created to store the data. 
Then the check_price() function checks the price and appends it to the csv.
A while loop call the function then sleeps for a day, so it updates the price daily.
